            In the beginning of 2013, in conversation with Meharjot, his grandmother brought up the school in her hometown: Shree Jagdeesh Kanya Mahavidyalaya in Bhiwani, 3 hours away from Delhi. She spoke fondly of her school and was very keen that he visit. 
        </p>

        <p>
            At the school, the girls were agog with questions about Mumbai. However, Meharjot saw them more interested in science, but they did not have the resources or support that he did. Even in today's age of information, the students did not have a computer, let alone the internet or a library. Expensive laboratories, chemicals, equipment, and better textbooks seemed like a distant dream.
        </p>
        <p>
            In conversation with the students' families, Meharjot found that the older generation was orthodox, convinced that women were not meant be educated; so of course, women studying science was even more incredible to them. Hence, the number of girls at the school studying science as higher studies was abysmal. The stark truth of economic and gender disparities became evident to Meharjot. 
        </p>

        <p>
            They did value knowledge strongly, probably more so because it was scarcer for them. Meharjot had had been inspired by science's infinite scope and its heroic innovators, and he was upset that the girls could not receive the same opportunity. 
        </p>
        <p>
            He spoke to his good friend, Harsh Kedia about it and they held presentation on the 'History of Science' at the school. They spoke about the discoveries of great women in science such as Marie Curie, Rosalind Franklin and Gertrude Elion to elucidate that women too have influenced science. The presentation became not only a journey of science through time, but also a journey past various emotional barriers for the girls; this was possible by eliminating the information asymmetry about the career-possibilities in science. 
        </p>
        <p>
            They tailored the teaching methods to include more practical experiments and increase contemporary scientific awareness. One day, a girl got a pencil to class, put it in a glass of water, pointed that it appeared crooked and explained this phenomenon by the refraction of light. Much later, the Principal revealed that Meharjot and Harsh had facilitated a 30% increase in the number of girls who chose Science as a subject this year in the school. He was so pleased that he had raised funds to acquire a new computer-lab and asked Meharjot and Harsh to spare some time to teach the girls there during their next holidays. Additionally, he helped them affiliate with N.M Marg and M.P Municipal schools in Mumbai to continue the initiative, because the problem was widespread in regional-language medium schools in relatively developed cities too. 
        </p>
        <p>
            After receiving feedback from these schools, Meharjot and Harsh realized that the students were especially interested in the technological presentations they delivered. With Sharique, they then thought of making videos for them in their regional languages, following the impact of Khan Academy, PatrickJmt, EconplusDal and other such resources on the three during the IB. 
        </p>
        <p>
            After attempting to make a few videos, they realised that three people was far too few to achieve the ambitious goal. They then included their tech-savvy buddy, Divyansh who was more than keen to help out and Achal, an aspiring entrepreneur into the team. Divyansh would assist with the web-development and videography while Achal would be responsible for outreach, marketing and funding. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, with the new additions, the enthused team of Vids for Kids aims to make videos in regional languages Hindi and Marathi to reduce the disparity between those educated in English and the others in the small way that they can. Every small step counts, so we depend on you to help us and spread the word!

  The inspiration for Vids for Kids came from my grandmother's school in Bhiwani, Haryana. What started off there as mere dissatisfaction with a social system has now evolved into a machine for change and I am extremely proud to be promulgating this movement. Although we have been able to achieve significant progress in Jagdeesh Kanya school, NM Marg School and MP school, I believe that there is a lot of scope for expansion of the project. I believe that technology in general, and educational videos in specific are great resources for any student. It is saddening that Indian students, who are not educated in English cannot avail of such resources, because till today no such resources are available in regional Indian languages. It is my genuine wish that Vids for Kids, by reducing this information assymetry on the web, inspire more women to take up science and thus reduce the gender disparity prevalent in Indian education.

  My name is Sharique and I study Material Science and Engineering at Imperial College London. Whenever I have had a doubt or a query, the internet has always come to my rescue; however, my friends and I have recognised that the power of the Internet is best harnessed by a superior knowledge of English. 'Vids for kids' was conceived to make scientific understanding available to students in Hindi and present it in a clear and coherent way. While I would love to help every student in our country in their native language, at the end of the day if we manage to inspire a single student in the slightest and show them the exciting side of science, as opposed to the rote learning method presented in traditional state syllabi, then I would be happy!

 When Meharjot asked me if I was interested in being a part of his project, I knew deep in my heart that is something I wanted to work on, as I deeply care about spreading education, and spreading education to girls in India is especially important as it will help mitigate the gender disparities that exist in Indian society. I hope to contribute to the project by making clear and interesting videos that engage the students and generate a passion for learning. I also hope to carry out A/B testing to improve the website's layout in response to the students' usage of the website.

  I currently study Economics and Statistics at the University of California, Berkeley. One of the most distinguishing characteristics I have is the diversity of experiences I own.  I like to take up interesting opportunities and work on them diligently to contribute and gain the most I can. Some of the opportunities that I have taken up have been in the field of finance, economics, accounting, marketing and sales, psychology and the sciences. I intend to maintain a global perspective with my career, where I can combine my interest in the technology revolution with my attraction towards the financial world. I am also inclined towards innovative entrepreneurship through giving back to society, which is why I have taken up this initiative of making online scientific education available to students in their native language in India to show them the exciting side of science and inspire them to pursue it at a higher level through 'Vids for Kids'.
